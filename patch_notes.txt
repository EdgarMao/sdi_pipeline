Let this file serve as a record of various updates. This will denote a more detailed description than the commit titles.




SDI Pipeline v1.2 5/20/19 made by Jamie Clark (introducing auto.py, version control, and small changes)
- created an automation script for the pipeline called auto.py. This script allows the user to run the pipeline with a single command (python -m sdi_pipeline.auto) and asks all the necessary questions for the pipeline at the start as opposed to throughout the script. Intended to replace manually runnning the pipeline, although that functionality is preserved
- made changes to get.py, align.py, combine.py, subtract.py, extract.py to allow auto.py to run through them while omitting the input prompts. Preserved manual functionality(still asks the questions if the script is not being called from auto.py) 
- within auto.py, created easy, intermediate, and advanced modes that let the user run the pipeline with varying degrees of freedom with regard to the options. easy asks no questions, advanced asks a lot
- changed initialize.py to not ask questions anymore(yes, always run and no, don't install ISIS)
- added a reset function/command (see reset.py) and added this as a functionality to run within auto.py
- added defaults to all the questions (at least all those that could be defaulted. all except the import system) asked in auto.py and in the individual command files (get, align, combine, subtract, extract)
- added an "import system" in auto.py that has functionality to import files directly from /seti_data/raw_data to the user's Downloads folder via a little "menu" of sorts
- tidied up comments a bit and changed some of the messages displayed to the user to be more informative
- added version control. This is v1.2.
