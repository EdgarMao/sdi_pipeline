## TODO for Subtraction
* AIS and IBIS methods were removed -- do `git show` from a ref earlier than 
2019-09-04; we may need to evaluate them to determine if they are more effective
* Master residual logging; used to exist, was commented out
* There seemed to be some operations happening before subtraction; either 
align\_skimage or  align\_chi2; do we need that?
